4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I did not consult anyone.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
For descriptions.js, I edited the default DOMContentLoaded listener code to run loadSavedRunkeeperTweets().then(parseTweets) before addEventHandlerForSearch() because my search code cannot work otherwise.
For activities.js, I edited the default DOMContentLoaded listener code to also add an event listener for aggregate.
